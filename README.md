## My Passion

It is a lie to say that computers are fascinating me since i'm born, but it feels like that.

In fact, they have been doing this since my last few years of school.

I like to work with the latest technology and i prefer the open source software.

Enterprise level technology is where i'm feeling well, but i also love to play
with very tiny computers like the Raspberry Pi or the Arduino, do some soldering
and building various electronic circuits.

Working with various cloud platforms, virtualized systems and the whole DevOps software
stack is currently my daily business, which i really like.

I'm very happy that my hobby is my job.

I have very high expectations of myself and my permanent objective is,
building the smartest systems i'm able to.

My dream would be to build a fully automated, always available and always updated system.
